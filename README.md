# algorithms-c
For now, I have just sqrt_pow.c, where I tried to re-invent sqrt and pow functions in a fast and brief way. Sqrt is just 23 multiplications, 23 bitshifts and 23 additions, which I think is quite fast, and pow is maximum 46 multiplication, and maximum 23 sqrt, which I think is pretty good with no table nor formal education in this field.
